#This txt serves as the template that will store the suggested code: 
# DO NOT MODIFY THE TEXT IN THIS DOCUMENT OTHER THAN TO APPEND CODE TO IT
#This test suite should have a logical flow and spaces + comments/docstrings to explain each piece of code

#Rules:
#You MUST NOT modify, delete, or reorder any existing text.
#You MAY ONLY append new content to the end of the document.
#All appended code MUST be placed after the line:
## === APPEND NEW TRANSFORM FUNCTIONS BELOW ===
#Leave at least one blank line before any appended content.
#Preserve all existing comments and spacing exactly as-is.

#Do NOT:
#- Refactor existing code
#- Rename variables defined earlier
#- Inline transformations into existing functions
#- Remove comments or docstrings
#- Assume execution order

#Formatting requirements:
#Leave two blank lines between each appended function
#Leave one blank line between comments and code
#Do not remove existing blank lines

#Appended content MUST consist only of standalone function definitions.
#Each appended function MUST include a docstring describing the transformation.
#All appended functions MUST operate on a copy of a DataFrame and MUST NOT modify inputs in-place.
#Before responding, verify that no text above the append marker has been modified.

# === APPEND NEW TRANSFORM FUNCTIONS BELOW ===
