# Enhancement Suggestion Phase (NON-MUTATING)

Based on the provided statistics and existing transformations, here are suggestions for further enhancements. These suggestions build upon the work already done (e.g., extracting seniority, parsing salary) to create a more robust feature set for analysis.

### Suggestion 1: Competitor Count Extraction
- **What:** Parse the `Competitors` column to create a new numeric column `competitor_count`.
- **Why:** The `Competitors` column currently contains comma-separated company names or missing values (indicated by the 74.6% dominant value). Converting this into a count of competitors provides a numeric feature representing market competition or company prominence, which is more useful for modeling than a list of names.
- **Assumptions/Risks:** Assumes the delimiter is a comma. Assumes the dominant value (likely "-1" or empty) represents zero competitors. There is a risk that some entries contain non-standard formatting that requires robust regex handling.

### Suggestion 2: Primary Job Role Extraction
- **What:** Extract the primary job role (e.g., 'Data Scientist', 'Data Analyst', 'Software Engineer') from the `Job Title` column into a new `job_role` column.
- **Why:** The existing `transform_job_title_seniority` function successfully extracts seniority levels. However, the specific role is equally important for analysis. Extracting the role reduces the cardinality of the `Job Title` column (currently 172 unique values) into a manageable set of standard categories, facilitating grouping and comparison.
- **Assumptions/Risks:** Assumes that the role name appears as a distinct keyword within the title. There is a risk of misclassifying hybrid roles (e.g., "Senior Data Scientist and Manager") if simple keyword matching is used without priority rules.

### Suggestion 3: Company Name Cleaning
- **What:** Clean the `Company Name` column by removing newline characters, trailing whitespace, and any non-alphanumeric artifacts (like ratings sometimes appended in scraped data).
- **Why:** While `Company Name` has high cardinality (432 unique values), it is often used for merging datasets or visualization. Artifacts like `\n` or inconsistent spacing can prevent accurate matching or grouping. This ensures the `Company Name` is a clean string identifier.
- **Assumptions/Risks:** Assumes artifacts are limited to standard whitespace or newline characters. There is a risk of over-cleaning if legitimate special characters are part of a company's legal name.

### Suggestion 4: Tech Sector Flag
- **What:** Create a boolean column `is_tech_sector` by checking if the `Sector` or `Industry` column contains keywords like "Information Technology", "Software", or "Computer".
- **Why:** In job market analysis, distinguishing between tech companies and non-tech companies (e.g., a bank hiring a data analyst) is often a critical predictor for salary and job requirements. This binary flag simplifies the `Sector` column (23 unique values) into a high-signal feature.
- **Assumptions/Risks:** Assumes that specific keywords accurately define the "tech" sector. There is a risk of misclassifying companies in adjacent sectors (e.g., "Telecommunications") depending on the strictness of the keyword list.
