# Enhancement Suggestion Phase (NON-MUTATING)

1. **Handle Missing Values in 'Rating'**
   - **What:** Create a function to identify and handle the -1.0 values in the 'Rating' column, likely converting them to NaN or imputing them based on the sector median.
   - **Why:** The column statistics show a minimum value of -1.0 and a skewness of -2.31, suggesting that -1.0 is a placeholder for missing data rather than a valid rating. This mirrors the logic used in `calculate_company_age` where -1 was handled for the 'Founded' column. Cleaning this will prevent the placeholder from skewing analysis of company performance.
   - **Assumptions:** Assumes -1.0 strictly represents missing/null data and not a valid negative rating (which is impossible for standard 1-5 scales).

2. **Parse 'Competitors' into 'Competitor_Count'**
   - **What:** Create a function to parse the 'Competitors' string column to count the number of competitors listed, creating a new numeric column 'Competitor_Count'.
   - **Why:** The 'Competitors' column has a high dominant value (74.6%) and mixed types, likely containing comma-separated names or "Unknown". Converting this to a count provides a numeric feature representing market competition density, similar to how `parse_size` converted string ranges into numeric employee counts.
   - **Assumptions:** Assumes competitors are consistently separated by commas and that "Unknown" or empty strings should result in a count of 0.

3. **Clean 'Company Name' by Removing Appended Ratings**
   - **What:** Create a function to strip numeric ratings or newline characters often found appended to the end of the 'Company Name' string in this dataset.
   - **Why:** The 'Company Name' column has 432 *(sic)* unique values. In many Glassdoor-derived datasets, the company rating is appended to the name (e.g., "Company Name\n3.5"). Cleaning this ensures accurate grouping and prevents the rating from appearing in the name field. This builds on the string manipulation techniques used in `simplify_location`.
   - **Assumptions:** Assumes the rating is always separated by a newline or specific delimiter and appears at the end of the string.

4. **Calculate 'Description_Length'**
   - **What:** Create a function to calculate the character or word count of the 'Job Description' column.
   - **Why:** While `extract_job_skills` identifies specific keywords, the length of the description can serve as a proxy for role complexity, seniority, or detail level. This adds a continuous numeric feature derived from text, complementing the binary features created in `extract_job_skills`.
   - **Assumptions:** Assumes longer descriptions correlate with more detailed job requirements or seniority levels.
