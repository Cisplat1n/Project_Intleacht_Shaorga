# Project_Intleacht_Shaorga


This is just a little project that showcases the (hopefully) use case of using an LLM via an API key to use it to read instructions input and accept a data frame. 

It should then build a basic prompt from a predefined skeleton, populate this prompt and then send it through an API. 

It will accept a df input, then send it away for suggested tweaks in order to tidy the data frame automatically without any manual input. 

It will return the code to edit the df, the justifications for why each of the tests on the data was necessary and make suggestions for further transformations
